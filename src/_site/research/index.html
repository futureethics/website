        <main class="main"><h1>Research</h1>
<p>Future Ethics investigates the relationship between people and computers, between society and AI. Our research focuses on making AI systems safer and more reliable in sectors where the stakes are highest.</p>
<h2>Current Research Areas</h2>
<h3>Human-AI Decision Making</h3>
<p>We study how people and AI systems make decisions together, particularly in high-stakes environments. Our work examines when human oversight is effective, when it fails, and how to design better human-AI collaboration patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Current focus:</strong> Decision-making patterns in healthcare diagnosis, legal case assessment, and financial risk evaluation.</p>
<h3>AI Safety in Critical Sectors</h3>
<h4>Healthcare AI Safety</h4>
<p>We investigate failure modes in medical AI systems and develop frameworks for safe deployment. Our research covers diagnostic AI reliability, treatment recommendation systems, and patient data protection in AI workflows.</p>
<p><strong>Recent work:</strong> Analysis of diagnostic AI failure patterns across 50+ healthcare systems, development of safety checklists for medical AI deployment.</p>
<h4>Legal AI Governance</h4>
<p>We examine the intersection of AI systems and legal processes, focusing on bias detection, accountability frameworks, and due process in automated decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>Recent work:</strong> Framework development for AI transparency in legal proceedings, bias assessment tools for judicial AI systems.</p>
<h4>Financial AI Risk Assessment</h4>
<p>We study systemic risks introduced by AI in financial systems, including algorithmic trading safety, credit decision fairness, and AI-driven market manipulation detection.</p>
<p><strong>Recent work:</strong> Risk assessment methodologies for AI trading systems, fairness auditing tools for credit AI.</p>
<h3>AI Alignment in Practice</h3>
<p>We research how to align AI systems with human values in real-world deployments, moving beyond theoretical alignment to practical implementation challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Current focus:</strong> Value specification in domain-specific AI systems, monitoring techniques for deployment drift, feedback mechanisms for improving alignment over time.</p>
<h2>Research Approach</h2>
<p>We combine empirical analysis of existing AI systems with the development of practical safety tools. Our work bridges academic research and industry implementation, ensuring our findings can be applied immediately to make AI systems safer.</p>
<p>Our methodology includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Field studies of AI systems in production environments</li>
<li>Failure mode analysis across industry sectors</li>
<li>Development of safety assessment frameworks</li>
<li>Testing and validation of safety interventions</li>
</ul>
<h2>Publications &amp; Findings</h2>
<p>Research papers, safety frameworks, and case studies are published through academic conferences, industry journals, and our research blog. We prioritize open publication to advance the field of AI safety broadly.</p>
<p>[Recent publications and findings would be listed here]</p>
<h2>Research Collaboration</h2>
<p>We collaborate with academic institutions, industry partners, and regulatory bodies to ensure our research addresses real-world safety challenges. Our work informs both AI development practices and policy frameworks.</p>
<p>Current collaborations include partnerships with healthcare systems, financial institutions, legal organizations, and academic research labs focused on AI safety.</p>
