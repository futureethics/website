  <h1>AI Safety Projects That Expose Hidden Risks</h1>
  <p class="page-subtitle">
    We investigate AI safety problems before they become headlines. Here are three recent projects that demonstrate how proper safety assessment prevents costly failures.
  </p>

<div class="project-grid">
  
  <div class="project-card">
    <h2 class="project-title">The Global AI Safety Blind Spot</h2>
    <p class="project-subtitle">Multicultural Red Teaming</p>
    
    <div class="project-section">
      <h4>The Hidden Risk</h4>
      <p>Your AI passes English safety tests but fails catastrophically in other languages and cultures—creating legal, compliance, and reputation exposure you don't know about.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-section">
      <h4>What We Did</h4>
      <p>Conducted the world's first systematic multicultural AI safety assessment across <strong>9 countries and 8 languages</strong>, exposing dangerous failure modes invisible to traditional testing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-section">
      <h4>What We Found</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>AI systems showed dramatically different failure patterns when tested in non-English languages</li>
        <li>Cultural context significantly affected AI responses to identical logical prompts</li>
        <li>Safety measures designed for English-speaking users failed completely in multilingual environments</li>
        <li>Critical vulnerabilities emerged through cultural code-switching and non-Latin script attacks</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <strong>Business Impact:</strong> If your AI serves global markets, traditional safety testing misses critical failure modes. Companies deploying AI internationally face hidden compliance violations and reputation risks that could trigger regulatory action or customer backlash.

  <div class="project-card">
    <h2 class="project-title">Medical AI's Malpractice Problem</h2>
    <p class="project-subtitle">When Chatbots Give Dangerous Advice</p>
    
    <div class="project-section">
      <h4>The Hidden Risk</h4>
      <p>Healthcare organizations are deploying medical chatbots without understanding their failure modes, creating patient safety risks and malpractice liability exposure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-section">
      <h4>What We Did</h4>
      <p>Systematically tested medical AI chatbots across common patient scenarios to identify when and how they provide dangerous medical advice that could harm patients.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-section">
      <h4>What We Found</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Medical chatbots regularly contradicted established clinical guidelines</li>
        <li>Systems failed to recognize emergency symptoms requiring immediate medical attention</li>
        <li>Chatbots delivered confident-sounding but medically incorrect responses to complex health questions</li>
        <li>Liability gaps emerged where AI advice diverged from standard medical practice</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <strong>Business Impact:</strong> Healthcare organizations using AI chatbots may be creating malpractice exposure they don't realize exists. Every incorrect AI response is a potential lawsuit waiting to happen.

  <div class="project-card">
    <h2 class="project-title">The Child Safety Challenge</h2>
    <p class="project-subtitle">Testing Educational AI Without Harm</p>
    
    <div class="project-section">
      <h4>The Hidden Risk</h4>
      <p>Educational institutions deploy AI chatbots for students without understanding child safety risks—and without safe testing methodologies to assess them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-section">
      <h4>What We Did</h4>
      <p>Developed age-appropriate AI safety testing protocols that assess educational chatbot risks without exposing children to harmful content during the safety assessment process.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-section">
      <h4>What We Found</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Educational AI systems could be manipulated to provide inappropriate content to minors</li>
        <li>Standard AI safety testing methods would expose children to harmful content during assessment</li>
        <li>Schools lacked frameworks for evaluating AI safety in educational contexts before deployment</li>
        <li>Child safety regulations weren't being properly considered in educational AI deployment</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <strong>Business Impact:</strong> Educational institutions using AI face potential regulatory violations, parent backlash, and student safety incidents. Standard enterprise AI safety measures fail to protect children or institutional reputation.

## Our Approach: Safety Before Deployment

<div class="two-column">
  <div class="research-area">
    <h4>Why Traditional AI Testing Fails</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Focuses only on English-language, Western cultural contexts</li>
      <li>Misses failure modes that emerge in real-world deployment conditions</li>
      <li>Lacks specialized protocols for high-stakes sectors</li>
      <li>Tests for known problems rather than discovering unknown vulnerabilities</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="research-area">
    <h4>Our Safety Assessment Process</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Multicultural Testing:</strong> Evaluate AI across languages and cultures</li>
      <li><strong>Sector-Specific Protocols:</strong> Tailored assessment for critical sectors</li>
      <li><strong>Real-World Scenarios:</strong> Test under actual deployment conditions</li>
      <li><strong>Compliance Analysis:</strong> Identify regulatory exposure early</li>
