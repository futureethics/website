## Who We Are

Future Ethics is the world's leading multicultural AI safety research organization. We specialize in discovering hidden vulnerabilities that emerge when AI systems encounter languages, cultures, and contexts they weren't designed for.

While most AI safety testing focuses on English-speaking, Western contexts, we've built the expertise and networks to evaluate AI safety across the full spectrum of human cultures and languages. Our work prevents costly failures, regulatory violations, and reputational damage for organizations deploying AI at global scale.

**What makes us unique:**

      <p>Adrianna builds things that matter. As a technical program manager and AI safety researcher, she's spent the last few years figuring out how to make AI systems less likely to cause harm.</p>
      
      <p>She led the world's first multicultural AI red teaming challenge across Asia-Pacific—coordinating 350+ experts across 9 countries and 8 languages to create new methodologies for testing AI safety across cultures, together with Humane Intelligence and Singapore's IMDA.</p>
      
      <p>She's also run AI assurance programs for the U.S. Department of Defense and led safety evaluations for major EdTech platforms. Before diving into AI safety, Adrianna spent over a decade building products that actually work for people—from Indonesia's early mobile payment networks to San Francisco's COVID-19 response systems.</p>
